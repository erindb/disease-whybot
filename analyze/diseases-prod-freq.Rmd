Here's a quick notebook to look at the diseases people came up with. I cleaned them by hand a bit, and we'll clean up a little more here.

```{r fig.asp=.75}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
diseases <- read.csv("../data/diseases-processed.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

diseases %>% 
  mutate(Response=str_to_lower(Response)) %>%
  mutate(Response=factor(Response, levels=names(sort(table(Response), decreasing=TRUE)))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Response)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="count") + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
